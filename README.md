# What is Blue Light Blocker 
This applet is the equivalent to '**Night Light**' on Windows, or '**Night Shift**' on macOS. 

It acts as a blue light filter and makes your display use warmer colors, according to your likings. This applet, **Blue Light Blocker**, also allows you to control the brightness of your screen at will. 

# YOU are in control!
Is it still day time? Is it night time? Who cares! Don't let the clock dictate when your screen has to block blue light from entering your precious little eyes! 

You want to block blue light *all day*? You got it!
You want to block blue light *only at night*? It's your call, boss!
You want to block blue light *only when you feel like it*? No problemo! 

You can enable and disable this applet anytime in merely 2 clicks! 
Adjusting the warmth tone of your screen or it's brightness is as easy as ever, thanks to simple sliders with real-time feedback!
